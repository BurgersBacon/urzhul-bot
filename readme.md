this is how one of its tweets looks like:

<div class="center">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/7Y37abskHS">pic.twitter.com/7Y37abskHS</a></p>&mdash; urzhúl (@snaqchat) <a href="https://twitter.com/snaqchat/status/1193743783264968705?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 11, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div>

#### at least give some credit

in order to promote a little of decency to the content posted by `urzhúl bot`, `burgrbot` (another twitter bot) shares the link of the content and the reddit user of the one who posted it.

it is known that maybe this is not the original source of the media, but at least it gives a hint to find it, and off course, also promoting Reddit, which is where all this content is originally posted.
